This cross-cutting interdisciplinary course, taught jointly between the College of Information Studies and the Department of Computer Science, investigates the role that algorithms and automated decision-making systems play in markets, societies, and policymaking. The course connects policy and computational conceptualizations of transparency, security, fairness, privacy, manipulation, and accountability through a series of casestudies and burning debates. Students will collaborate cross-disciplinary and be encouraged to work through difficult trade-offs to reach consensus. By discussing recent applications of algorithms for social and consumer sorting, and the moderation and generation of content, students will engage with the pressing challenges and opportunities in the governance of and by algorithms.",

We will cover a range of models, from linear regression to probabilistic forecasts and AI foundation models, and explore how to help human users understand and manage uncertainty in these computational models. Core topics include statistical communication, explainability, decision-making, uncertainty visualization, and LLM/LMM uncertainty. The course format includes a combination of readings, presentations, discussions, and lectures.",
