Can emerging technologies support the interpretation, experience, and reception of public art in new, and imaginative, ways? This course invites students to empirically study the modern history and civic values of public art spanning sculpture, painting, mixed-media, and installation. We consider the nature of public space, the politics of representation and community, and the civic and memorial functions of art. Leveraging a panoply of digital tools, students generate metadata, prototype creative interventions and experiences, and collectively write a community-sourced history of public art.","is_recent":true,"geneds":null}}},{"pageContent":"How (and Why) to Look at Art in the Era of Climate Change\nHow can art help us build the mindset necessary for fashioning a sustainable civilization?
